# Better Ecology
I know the game isn't really about that, but rather even the opposite, but still, it's never too late to care a little about the environment :3

## Main features

 - Wind turbine
 - Tree planter
 - Air purifer (requires air filter as a consumable)
 - Ecology modules (which are, in fact, upgraded versions of efficiency modules)
 - Dynamic wind speed (Wind turbine power production is constantly changing)


## Plans

 - Custom modules for air purifier increasing its efficiency
 - Changes and improvements for Factorio: Space Age

*Stable work in Factorio 2.0 is NOT guaranteed.*

*Feel free to send your comments, suggestions and especially bug reports to the discussions.*
